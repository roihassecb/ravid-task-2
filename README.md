This projrct display my portfolio and my projects over the time

I used in my project a new CSS propertis:
- **calc()** function to calulate the heigth of the main container with the heigth of the fixed navigation bar 
- **transform: translate(-50%, -50%)** to make the titles of the navigation icons in the center of the icons 
- **media-query** to support small screens and responsive design
- **box-shadow** to add some style to my project cards
- **flex-wrap** to make flex items break row if no enough space in one line

### External JS library

### Custom JS
I've also used for the fitst time a cusom function to show an hamburger menu on small screens instead of a navigation bar my function called **showHideNavToggle** and she add a custom class that hide the icons on small screen and display tham after click on hamburger button
