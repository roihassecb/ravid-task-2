          <h2>Information about pineapple</h2>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Pineapple (scientific name: Ananas comosus) is a species of tropical
          plant from the bromeliad family that grows in the wild in Brazil,
          Bolivia and Paraguay. The pineapple is a small perennial plant with
          30â€“100 cm long leaves surrounding a thick stem. Each plant produces
          one fruit that comes off the stem.

          <h2>The structure of the pineapple</h2>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The skin of the fruit consists of spiky hexagonal protrusions, the
          outer skin of each hexagon consists of three leaflets under which is a
          yellow or white membrane. The hexagons are attached to a core attached
          to the stem of the plant. The size of the pineapple can reach up to 30
          cm in length and weigh 1-3 kg. In nature, pineapples contain many
          seeds, one for each flower. In contrast, commercially grown pineapples
          almost never contain seeds.

          <h2>The uses of the fruit</h2>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Pineapple is often used in desserts and fruit salads, but it is also
          used in many other dishes. A famous example is a Hawaiian-style pizza,
          which is topped with pineapple and smoked meat. Another well-known use
          of pineapple is in Asian dishes of noodles in stir-fried sauce with
          various vegetables (such as cauliflower, broccoli, beans and more). In
          Hawaii it is customary to use pineapple juice to make an alcoholic
          drink called "pineapple wine". Because of the special enzymes in it,
          pineapple juice can be used as a silage or as a meat tenderizer. Also,
          there are many drinks such as pineapple juice or smoothies in which
          pineapple is combined.

        </ul>
        <p>
          The pineapple spread from its natural growing area under the influence
          of civilization, and by the time of Christopher Columbus it had
          reached all over South and Central America and the Caribbean islands.
          Columbus brought the pineapple with him on his return to Europe, and
          from Spain he moved to the Philippines and Hawaii. The fruit was
          successfully acclimatized in greenhouses across Europe as early as
          1720. The name of the fruit in the English language (Pineapple) is
          derived from its pine cone-like appearance.

        <p>
          Since the natural climate is not optimal, growing in Israel is done in
          greenhouses in the summer covered with a "shade net" to prevent direct
          sunlight and in the winter covered with plastic to protect against the
          cold. The amount of growth is estimated at 2,000 to 2,500 tons per
          year.

          The pineapple is very common in Thailand and tropical environments.
          Almost everyone who has been to Thailand talks longingly about the
          taste of the Thai pineapple. But the origin of the pineapple is
          apparently in the forests of Brazil in South America.

          Why does pineapple juice help? It is especially rich in vitamin C,
          which is important for strengthening the immune system and protecting
          the body against diseases. 100 grams of pineapple will provide about
          60% of the recommended daily dose of vitamin C.

          Today, pineapples are also grown in Africa, especially in Kenya and
          South Africa. But precisely the countries of Southeast Asia, such as
          Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia and the Ivory
          Coast are the world leaders in pineapple cultivation.
